# Star_classification
This Python project aims to create a star classification system using a dataset containing diverse star features such as absolute temperature, relative luminosity, relative radius, absolute magnitude, star color, spectral class, and star type. The main objective is to build a machine-learning model capable of effectively categorizing stars into various types based on these features. The project should be an executable Python application, providing users with the choice of interaction through either a command-line interface(CLI) or a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

By implementing Streamlit, a user-friendly GUI is created.
